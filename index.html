        <p>The Spotted Lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula, is an invasive species that poses as a threat to our food supply. Lanternflies are native to parts of East Asia, where they have natural predators. They have started appearing in the United States in Pennsylvania. With the absence of a natural predator they are now spreading across the east coast. The bugs are now taking over New York City. It is up to us, as humans, to step up and become the predators. But how do we get rid of the lanternflies? We kill them. Simple. Our primal instinct to hunt and kill has diminished since development of civilizations. This can make it difficult for us to kill the lanternflies. Some may find them scary. Some may find them pretty. Some may find it boring even.

            Whilst I used to feel bad having to kill these bugs, they are vermin that have spread to every nook and cranny. My final straw was going home after a night class right before midnight and hearing a scratching sound on my desk. After realizing that I wasn’t imagining things I flipped over a piece of paper to spot a lanternfly in my room. It was a truly visceral moment and made me develop a personal vendetta against the lanternflies in addition to contemplating burning everything in my room. These bugs also colonize quickly, and this is maybe why I have such distain towards them.
