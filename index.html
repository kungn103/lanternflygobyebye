        <p>The Spotted Lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula, is an invasive species that poses as a threat to our food supply. Lanternflies are native to parts of East Asia, where they have natural predators. They have started appearing in the United States in Pennsylvania. With the absence of a natural predator they are now spreading across the east coast. The bugs are now taking over New York City. It is up to us, as humans, to step up and become the predators. But how do we get rid of the lanternflies? We kill them. Simple. Our primal instinct to hunt and kill has diminished since development of civilizations. This can make it difficult for us to kill the lanternflies. Some may find them scary. Some may find them pretty. Some may find it boring even.

            Whilst I used to feel bad having to kill these bugs, they are vermin that have spread to every nook and cranny. My final straw was going home after a night class right before midnight and hearing a scratching sound on my desk. After realizing that I wasn’t imagining things I flipped over a piece of paper to spot a lanternfly in my room. It was a truly visceral moment and made me develop a personal vendetta against the lanternflies in addition to contemplating burning everything in my room. These bugs also colonize quickly, and this is maybe why I have such distain towards them.

        <p>The tried and true instinctual method of killing insects. Whilst we are often discouraged from stepping on and arbitrarily deciding to take the life of another living being as children, this does not apply to the lanternfly. Assert your dominance as a larger creature to your heart’s content. </p>

        <p> First time I  saw a lanternfly was on a rooftop. I found the bug quite beautiful to look at. I simply had to let my loyal instagram followers know. To my dismay I was immediately informed that I was, in fact, stupid. This bug is an invasive species and so I killed it after exploiting its’ beauty. </p>

        <p>Lanternflies, similar to other insects are weak swimmers. If you have sadistic tendencies and want to inflict pain upon this bug prior to killing it this may be a method to explore. Some say that drowning is one of the worst ways to die because you can feel every moment of it.  </p>

        <p>This is another slow method of killing in which one hit does not kill the lanternfly, but slowly injures it to its eventual death. This happened to me once at a cafe where I tried to squash a lanternfly with an empty plastic cup. I accidentally didn’t kill it in one go and had to keep spashing and smushing the lanternfly. It deeply unsettled me and I get nightmares about it somtimes. Perhaps this was my karma for using single-use plastics. </p>

        <p>Insects are attracted to light. They can’t help it. What could be more fitting than killing a lanternfly with the very thing in its’ name? Traditional lanterns have a live flame. You could probably do this with a candle too and bury the corpse in the wax. Then you’d actually have completed a DIY project to domesticate a dead lanternfly for home decoration purposes.</p>

        <p>Fight nature with nature. Play god and plant some milkweed. Whilst the toxicity of milkweed towards lanternflies is still under debate, neem oil can be used to fend them off. But to be honest, it’s better if you just kill them on sight so they don’t spread any further.</p>
